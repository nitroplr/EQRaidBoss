# EQ Raid Boss

EQ Raid boss is a loot collector with a sharable block list, a basic raid dump parser, a plat parcels received parser, and a plat parcel sender / sent parser for EverQuest.

To use EQ Raid Boss, open the installers folder and download the .exe file.  Install the 
program, then click on the folder in the lower left corner and point to your character's log file.

Change the start and end dates to parse loot, raid attendance, plat parcels received, and parcels sent.  Hit now if you want it to monitor for 
changes.  Items can be added to the block list with a long press on the item on the Loots tab or by clicking the plus on the blocked items tab and adding new blocked items(1 per line, click the copy button in the upper right to share block lists).  Blocked items can be removed the same way.  Every screen has copy buttons to output data in a spreadsheet friendly format.  See this YouTube video for how to use the parcel sender.
