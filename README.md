# EQ Raid Boss

EQ Raid Boss is a loot collector that parses .zip and .gz archived files with a sharable block list, a basic raid dump parser, a plat parcels received parser, and a plat parcel sender / sent parser for EverQuest.  EQ Raid Boss also now meshes with Raid Builder to auto post loot and DKP Ticks.

To use EQ Raid Boss, click on releases on the right and download the .exe file.  Or go to this link:
https://github.com/nitroplr/EQRaidBoss/releases
Install the program, then click on the folder in the lower left corner and point to your character's log file.

Change the start and end dates to modify all log parsers.  Hit now if you want it to monitor for changes.  Items can be added to the block list with a long press on the item in the Loots tab or by clicking the plus on the blocked items tab and adding new blocked items(1 per line, click the copy button in the upper right to share block lists).  Blocked items can be removed with a long press or cleared entirely.  Every screen has copy buttons to output data in a spreadsheet friendly format.  See this YouTube video for how to use the parcel sender.
