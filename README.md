# EQ Raid Boss

To use EQ Raid Boss, open the installers folder on github and download the .exe file.  Install the 
program, then click on the folders in the lower left corner and point to your Everquest directory for the raid tick parser and do the same for your character's log file to use the loot collector.

Change the start and end dates to parse loot and raid attendance.  Hit now if you want it to monitor for 
changes.  Items can be added to the block list with a long press on the item on the Loots tab or by clicking the plus on the blocked items tab and adding new blocked items(1 per line).  Blocked items can be removed the same way.  Click on the output on the Loots or Ticks to copy a summary to clipboard in a format that is spreadsheet and Raid Builder friendly.
