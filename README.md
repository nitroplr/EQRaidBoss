# EQ Raid Boss

EQ Raid boss is a loot collector with a sharable block list, a basic raid dump parser, a plat parcels received parser, and a plat parcel sender for EverQuest.

To use EQ Raid Boss, open the installers folder and download the .exe file.  Install the 
program, then click on the folders in the lower left corner and point to your Everquest directory for the raid tick parser and do the same for your character's log file to use the loot collector, plat parcels received, and the plat parcel sender.

Change the start and end dates to parse loot, raid attendance, plat parcels received, and parcels sent.  Hit now if you want it to monitor for 
changes.  Items can be added to the block list with a long press on the item on the Loots tab or by clicking the plus on the blocked items tab and adding new blocked items(1 per line, click the copy button in the upper right to share block lists).  Blocked items can be removed the same way.  Click anywhere on the screen on the Loots or Ticks screen to copy a summary to clipboard in a format that is spreadsheet and Raid Builder friendly.
